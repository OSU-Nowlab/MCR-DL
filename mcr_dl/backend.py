MCR-DL Communication Backend.

MCR-DL supports NCCL and MPI with torch.distributed, as well as pure NCCL and MPI backend (i.e. without requiring torch.distributed). By default, torch.distributed is used.

# Custom DS Backends -- Direct C/Ops
 - NCCL -- [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - MPI -- [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - RCCL -- [EXPERIMENTAL]
 - GLOO -- [EXPERIMENTAL]
# DS backend wrapper for torch.distributed [DEFAULT]
 - T-NCCL -- [DEFAULT]
 - T-MPI

# Backend is the base class
     -- NCCLBackend, MPIBackend, and TorchBackend are the main subclasses.
